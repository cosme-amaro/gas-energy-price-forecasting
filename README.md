# Gas-Energy-Price-Forecasting
In the day-ahead energy market, owners of thermal generators offer to sell energy according to an
offer curve that specifies a price for different levels of generation. Since a thermal plant that is
on-line must operate at a minimum level of output (or be turned off), part of the specification of
the offer curve is the price per MW produced, when operating at the minimal sustained level of
output. This is referred to as mingen-cost.


The task is to determine the relationship between the mingen-cost and the two variables fuel-cost
(use data from Henry Hub natural gas spot price) and temperature (use provided csv), with the
purpose of being able to predict the mingen-cost of this plant in the future.
